* RQC - QuickCheck for Ruby
  This is an implementation of QuickCheck in Ruby, ported from the
  qc.js framework for Javascript. IT DOES NOT WORK YET (completely).

  Property-based testing is a large topic that cannot be fully
  explained in this README, but it is useful for:

  - Testing protocols (including well-crafted APIs)
  - Stateless behavior verification (without side-effects)
  - Automatic edge-case detection through fuzzing
  - Finding minimal failing test cases through shrinking
  - Increasing the breadth of examples in existing test suites
